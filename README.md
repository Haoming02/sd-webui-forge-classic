# Stable Diffusion WebUI Forge

Stable Diffusion WebUI Forge is a platform on top of [Stable Diffusion WebUI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) to make development easier, optimize resource management, speed up inference, and study experimental features.

> The name "Forge" is inspired from "Minecraft Forge". This project is aimed at becoming SD WebUI's Forge.

This fork mainly serves as an archive for the "classic," or the "old" version of the Forge, built on `Gradio 3` before the major changes, with some minor changes added.

> See the [Announcement](https://github.com/lllyasviel/stable-diffusion-webui-forge/discussions/801)
